              <p>If you're an Unreal Engine developer with CI/CD setup, you're probably using BuildCookRun to package your game for all the platforms you're targeting. BuildCookRun is inherently slow, because it performs all of its steps sequentially on a single machine.</p>
              Learn how to drastically reduce your Unreal Engine build times by using BuildGraph instead. In this talk I'll not only cover how to write BuildGraph scripts tailored to your project, but also how to integrate BuildGraph with your CI/CD server to distribute build steps across all of the build machines you have available.

              <p>A Momentary Meeting is about exploring an ever-changing world, and the fleeting interactions you have with other people along the way. A multiplayer text adventure where the links between "rooms" changes over time and occasionally you'll meet someone else in the same space. Your meeting is short lived however, as the ever changing world pulls you apart and thrusts you back somewhere nearby.</p>

The idea was a multiplayer narrative text adventure where you incidentally meet random strangers. I actually spent most my time doing the narrative and writing for this game, rather than the programming. I actually found it quite enjoyable to just write out descriptive scenes for the game.

              Multiplayer games are huge and have great potential for long term retention of players, and that leads to ongoing revenue for a studio, but to achieve this, you need to make sure your multiplayer experience is excellent. You won't get that just throwing whatever library you can find on the asset store and hoping for the best. This talk will teach you how to implement multiplayer from the ground up, allowing you to make sure your online player experience is the best it can be.

              I was running a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server in 2019, and I wanted some of the features you'd get in the Java Edition like showing player locations on an online map and chat synchronisation. Unfortunately Bedrock Edition is written in C++ so this kind of tooling wasn't readily available. I leveraged the PapyrusCS project to proxy all of the Minecraft traffic, see what players were doing on the server and then teleport the bot around to observe their location.

          <h2>8 Years of Game Development</h2>
          <hr />
          <p class="mt-2 mb-4 text-start">This period covers my time at university through to when we wrapped up Redpoint Games (the company). For almost all of this time I worked with Josh Harvey on game prototypes and plans on how to do game development sustainably. By the end of it we almost knew what we were doing, but we didn't have any money left and pursued our own careers in 2019.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">2018</h4>
          <p class="mt-2 text-start">In 2018, I was working with Josh and Liam on games at Redpoint Games. At this time Redpoint Games was a company with all three of us as directors. When Redpoint Games reformed in 2020, it was as a sole trader under myself only.</p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-start">This was the last year we pursued game development as a team. We were unsuccessful in obtaining funding for "Minute of Mayhem" from the local funding body Film Victoria, and we no longer had the financial runway to continue through to the next potential funding round.</p>

                Minute of Mayhem started as a prototype I developed in my last year of university in 2015. The game was initially called Sixty Seconds. The initial prototype was developed in Unity and presented at PAX Australia 2015 (through Swinburne University) and GX Australia (under Redpoint) in 2016. A trailer for the initial prototype when it was shown at PAX Australia is shown below:

              </div>
              <p>
                Following on from the prototype, we renamed it to Minute of Mayhem and started developing it from scratch in MonoGame using our own Protogame framework. I wrote a lot of features into Protogame throughout Minute of Mayhem's development in 2017 and 2018. A full feature list up until the retirement of the Protogame framework <a href="https://github.com/RedpointGames/Protogame#features">can be found on the GitHub page for Protogame</a>, but it includes things like a full deferred shading pipeline, network replication and hot reloading to name a few.

              <p>
                In 2017 we used Unreal Engine 4 for the first time, and were able to rebuild our work on Minute of Mayhem to date within two weeks. We switched away from Protogame to Unreal Engine and continued development in Unreal Engine until Minute of Mayhem was cancelled in 2018.

Again, the user interface is not shown." alt="A screenshot of what Minute of Mayhem looked like 2 weeks after switching to Unreal Engine. Again, the user interface is not shown." />
              After it's cancellation, we each pursued our own careers. Notably, this led to me starting work for Network Next as a contractor in the latter half of 2018 and as a full-time employee in early 2019.

              Perhaps the most interesting aspect of HiveMP was the revenue share and Steam financial data importing systems. We used this at Redpoint to automatically import the data from the Steam financial data portal so we could run analytics on it and compare against our other analytics sources, such as Google Analytics.

              <p>We released Dimension Jump in March 2017 to positive reviews. We ran a few community streams and had it in a few bundles, and it made around $2000 AUD over it's lifetime.</p>
              <p>In 2016 it was not possible to launch games on Steam without first going through Steam Greenlight. We wanted to start using the Steamworks APIs in Minute of Mayhem, but since we weren't approved for Steam we had no access to the backend. To this end, we decided to take the original Dimension Jump game that I'd released years ago, overhaul it and publish it on Steam through Steam Greenlight.</p>
              <p>By the time we published Dimension Jump, Steam Greenlight was on the way out, but it gave us a ton of experience in actually shipping a game to consumers on Steam.</p>
              <p>The original Dimension Jump was written in Game Maker 7, and we upgraded it to Game Maker Studio 1.4 in the version we released on Steam. However, Game Maker Studio 1.x ceased development and with no cost-effective upgrade path it became impractical to ship updates for the game.</p>
              In 2019 we made Dimension Jump free with a requirement to join our Discord server. The game wasn't generating revenue at this point, so we decided to use this as a way to build our Discord community. Unfortunately, we didn't take into account that players who got the game for free could leave negative reviews on the store page and we delisted the game from Steam in 2021.

            <div class="col-lg-6 my-sm-1 my-lg-0 text-lg-start">
              <p>This talk covered how to implement dependency injection in Unity games. Unfortunately the talks at UNITE 2015 weren't recorded (or at least, they're not online any more). However, the slides and source code are still available:</p>

              This was basically off the back of developing Sixty Seconds and another Unity-based game in my final year of university. This presentation is at least 7 years old and so it might not be relevant to modern Unity games, but you might find it useful even if only for historical purposes.

              Prototest is a lightweight testing framework for .NET. It requires no IDE plugins or extensions, nor does it require any command-line runners. Each test project is a .NET executable or application (depending on the target platform), and test execution is automatically run in parallel for you.

              <p>A board game that I developed with Josh Harvey at TIGJam Australia 2015. The idea is a cooperative/competitive board game where the rules perversely incentivise players to create the most impractical, badly designed cities.

              <p>We then did more playtesting and development until 2016. Below is a photo from playtesting session in January 2016.</p>

              After several rounds of playtesting, I think we decided to cancel the project as we couldn't figure out a set of rules that felt good <em>and</em> made sense.

              <p>The first version of JamCast was developed in 2012 during the first Melbourne Global Game Jam at La Trobe (Bundoora Campus). With game developers all in separate rooms, I wrote a version that captured bitmap images from developer desktops and sent them to the projectors in every room - the idea being to give people visibility on what other people were making throughout the jam. Keep in mind that in January 2012, Open Broadcaster Software hadn't even been released, let alone in wide use.</p>
              <p>At each Global Game Jam, it developed more features including Slack integration and pulling tweets from Twitter off a hashtag. I also had to adapt it to the unique networking setup of each event over the years, as Melbourne Global Game Jam has been hosted at La Trobe, Swinburne, AIE, JMC Academy and online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p>Although there are a few open source iterations of JamCast floating around on the Internet, it is now stored in the same private Git repository as JamHost, since it is now tightly coupled to that online event platform. Hence this entry doesn't link to any of the open source implementations as they're all significantly out-of-date.</p>
              JamCast now uses Open Broadcaster Software under the hood and relays video streams via NGINX RTMP.

              <p>The very first game engine I ever wrote. It was written in C++ and used Irrlicht for 3D rendering, Lua for scripting and Newton Physics for physics simulation. It had a light-weight C++ generator that would automatically generate Lua binding code for all of the native classes. I modified Lua to support things like a first-class type system and an 'is' operator for type comparisons. Reflecting on this in 2022, it is astounding that I was <em>15 years old</em> when I was first developing this and publishing this on the Internet.</p>
              <p>To emphasize the context in which this software was developed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is so old that source control history only starts in 2010. It would have initially been stored in Subversion, before moving to Mercurial. I'm not sure it was ever developed in Git; I suspect Google Code might have converted the repository when they exported it to GitHub after Google Code closed down.</li>
                <li>For the first few years of development, Unity wasn't even available for independent game developers to make 3D games in. In fact, the release of Unity as a low-cost 3D game engine is what killed the development of this engine once Unity was made freely available to developers. If I remember correctly, the original audience for this engine were game developers who wanted to go beyond what Game Maker was capable of; once Unity released their free tier there was no longer a market for the engine.</li>
                <li>I think the IDE started development in 2010. It was later repurposed for the MOAI game engine (which I did some contracting work for in 2011) but was never released.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I've included some screenshots from the Wayback Machine below. Images link to the Wayback Machine capture of the page. The first image is from December 2007.</p>

              <p>Ah yes, "lost it all in a USB crash". Classic 2007. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081022082239/http://www.roket-productions.com:80/?page=roket3d">later capture</a> shows it's evolution during 2008.</p>
              And yes, the name that my friends and I used for our projects during this period was "Roket Productions". We were 15 - don't hold it against us.
