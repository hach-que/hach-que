              <p>If you're an Unreal Engine developer with CI/CD setup, you're probably using BuildCookRun to package your game for all the platforms you're targeting. BuildCookRun is inherently slow, because it performs all of its steps sequentially on a single machine.</p>
              Learn how to drastically reduce your Unreal Engine build times by using BuildGraph instead. In this talk I'll not only cover how to write BuildGraph scripts tailored to your project, but also how to integrate BuildGraph with your CI/CD server to distribute build steps across all of the build machines you have available.

              <p>Working out of Santa Monica, California, I was a full stack engineer at Network Next. Our focus was building a platform that could more optimally route game network traffic over the Internet based on latency, jitter and packet loss.</p>
              <p>My work at Network Next involved:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Developing backend services in Go.</li>
                <li>Developing the front-end portal in React and TypeScript, most of which is still in use as of Sep 2022.</li>
                <li>Implementing and maintaining the Unreal Engine integration for the Network Next SDK.</li>
                <li>Managing the build and deployment process to deploy the platform into Kubernetes on Google Cloud.</li>
                <li>Maintaining the development environment through Skaffold and related tools.</li>
                <li>Ordering, evaluating and managing the relay machines that network traffic was routed over, in locations all around the world.</li>
              </ul>
              I moved back to Melbourne in November 2019, and left Network Next around February 2020.

          <p class="mb-4 text-start">This was the last year we pursued game development as a team. We were unsuccessful in obtaining funding for "Minute of Mayhem" from the local funding body Film Victoria, and we no longer had the financial runway to continue through to the next potential funding round.</p>

              <p>
                Minute of Mayhem started as a prototype I developed in my last year of university in 2015. The initial prototype was developed in Unity and presented at PAX Australia 2015 (through Swinburne University) and GX Australia (under Redpoint) in 2016.</p>
              <p>
                Following on from the prototype, we renamed it to Minute of Mayhem and started developing it from scratch in MonoGame using our own Protogame framework. I wrote a lot of features into Protogame throughout Minute of Mayhem's development in 2017 and 2018. A full feature list up until the retirement of the Protogame framework <a href="https://github.com/RedpointGames/Protogame#features">can be found on the GitHub page for Protogame</a>, but it includes things like a full deferred shading pipeline, network replication and hot reloading to name a few.

The user interface is not shown." alt="A screenshot of what Minute of Mayhem looked like prior to switching to Unreal Engine. The user interface is not shown." />
              <p>
                In 2017 we used Unreal Engine 4 for the first time, and were able to rebuild our work on Minute of Mayhem to date within two weeks. We switched away from Protogame to Unreal Engine and continued development in Unreal Engine until Minute of Mayhem was cancelled in 2018.

Again, the user interface is not shown." alt="A screenshot of what Minute of Mayhem looked like 2 weeks after switching to Unreal Engine. Again, the user interface is not shown." />
              After it's cancellation, we each pursued our own careers. Notably, this led to me starting work for Network Next as a contractor in the latter half of 2018 and as a full-time employee in early 2019.

              <p>HiveMP was a SaaS platform for game developers.</p>

              <p>I initially developed it to support our own games, and by the time it shutdown in 2019 it had support for:</p>

                  <ul>

              </ul>
              <p>Of course, almost all of the services it provided are now better served by platforms like EOS, but in 2017 cross-platform gameplay was still difficult for independent developers to do at low cost.</p>
              Perhaps the most interesting aspect of HiveMP was the revenue share and Steam financial data importing systems. We used this at Redpoint to automatically import the data from the Steam financial data portal so we could run analytics on it and compare against our other analytics sources, such as Google Analytics.
